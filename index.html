									<h2 class="major">My Story in a nutshell</h2>
									<p>I was born 9th of December 1996, I grew up in Dordrecht, The Netherlands. I have 2 older brothers. I loved computers ever since I was 8 years old. I always enjoyed writing code and seeing what it would do and this led me to pursue computer science. I studied Computer engineering before this but I didn't like working with the hardware so I quit and thats how I ended up to be a Computer Science student.</p>

                                            In this project we had to make an application that vizualized data.
                                            We decided to make an app that could show all points of interest with help of the <strong>Google Places API</strong>
                                            We stored the API data locally and was refreshed after every search.

                                            This was our 4th project and this was a pretty fun one, we were instructed to make an <strong>Android</strong> App, we decided on a scheduling app.
                                            We used <strong>Android Studio as an IDE</strong> and we wrote the App in <strong>Dart</strong> with the <strong>Flutter Framework</strong>. I learned a lot

                                            , <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> and <strong>ReactJS</strong>. I also learned how to scrape data from websites and how to design well thought out <strong>databases</strong> with
